# mttmzr/capri-starter-solid

A community starter template for the [Capri](https://capri.build) static site generator featuring:

- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- JSX instead of TSX
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- a custom directory structure

This template is heavily based on the original SolidJS template by Capri.

## Usage

Use the `Use this template` button or just clone this repo and remove the .git directory, then `npm i`

Theoretically, you should be able to use this community template when generating a new capri site, but I really had no luck with:

```sh
npm init capri my-capri-site -- -e mttmzr/capri-starter-solid
```
